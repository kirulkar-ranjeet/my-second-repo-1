
Is there a way I can keep track of commands I used in Git under Windows? I want to view all the commands that I have applied on my repository.

I want to be able to go back through the command history and figure out the command that caused the problem if one occurred.

Seeing the history of commits would be one thing, but for keeping a history of other actions such as creating a branch or adding a remote, are these tracked?
